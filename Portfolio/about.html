    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        Hi there! I'm Jason Bintang Setiawan, a first-semester Informatics student based in Universitas Ciputra Makassar, Indonesia.
        Currently immersed in the exciting world of algorithms, programming, and technology, I am passionate
        about leveraging my skills to solve real-world problems.
    </p>
    <p>
        My journey in the field of Informatics has just begun, but I am already enthusiastic about
        learning and applying my knowledge to create innovative solutions.
    </p>
    <p>
        As a student, I believe in the power of learning and collaboration. I am eager to
        explore new technologies, work on interesting projects, and connect with fellow enthusiasts in
        the vast and dynamic realm of Informatics.
    </p>
    <p>
        Beyond coding, I also value effective communication and teamwork. I believe that combining technical
        expertise with strong interpersonal skills is crucial for success in the ever-evolving field of
        information technology.
    </p>
    <p>
        Feel free to explore my portfolio to learn more about my projects, skills, and experiences. If you
        have any questions or if there's an opportunity for collaboration, I would love to hear from you!
    </p>
